            I am a curious and committed web developer with a strong drive to constantly learn new things.
             Over the past three years, I have built up expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, 
             Express and MongoDB â€“ both through courses and practical projects.
            I have worked in teams according to agile methods with GitHub and SCRUM, often in the role of
             SCRUM Master. In several projects, I have been responsible for both the front-end with reusable
              components and the back-end with APIs and databases.
